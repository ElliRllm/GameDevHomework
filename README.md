After Unity crashed today when I was finishing up the scripts stopped working. I couldn´t fix that so i remade the Project but now for some reason not all of the scripts work as did before Pre-Crash. I tryed fixing that in the last couple hours but couldn´t find a solution. The Problems only appear on the client even though that was working before. So I am really sorry to upload it like this but I already missed the deadline by two hours. I will try fixing this in the next couple of days and hope that that is okay.
